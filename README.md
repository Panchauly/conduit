**Conduit** deterministically projects events into SQL, document, key-value, and graph
stores using explicit, schema-driven mappings. It is **projection-only**: it consumes an
event log it does not own and never produces, buffers, or stores events itself (see
[`architecture.md` §1.1](architecture.md)).

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Panchauly/conduit.git
cd conduit
bash examples/sqlite-quickstart/run.sh
```

That's it — three events go in, a projected SQLite table comes out:

```
OK — app.db.users matches expected/users.txt:
u1|Ada|ada.lovelace@example.com
u2|Grace|grace@example.com
```

What just ran, unpacked (all under [`examples/sqlite-quickstart/`](examples/sqlite-quickstart/)):

```sh
conduit run --config config.yaml --mappings mappings --once
```

- **`config.yaml`** points at a `sqlite` adapter and a `directory` event source.
- **`mappings/sql/user_registered.yaml`** and **`user_email_changed.yaml`** map
  `event_type` → SQL columns, one file per event type.
- **`routing.json`** says which adapters each event type reaches.
- **`events/events.ndjson`** is the input — three NDJSON events.

Same event, three other storage kinds, one call each: `examples/postgres/` (a real
transactional Postgres backend), `examples/embedded/` (call `conduit-core` as a library,
no CLI), `examples/grpc-producer/` (stream events into a long-lived `conduit ingest`
service instead of reading a file).

## Why Conduit exists

A single event often needs to reach a SQL table (transactions), a document store (read
models), a key-value store (fast lookups), and a graph (relationships) — and that
fan-out logic tends to get duplicated across services, implemented inconsistently, and
be hard to reason about when something fails. Conduit centralizes it with deterministic
routing, explicit mappings, and a startup-time validation pass, so a redelivered or
out-of-order event is a clean, explainable skip rather than a duplicate write.

## Core principles

- **Event-first** — routing is by `event_type`, never content or metadata heuristics.
- **Deterministic** — no implicit behavior; the same event log always produces the same
  projected state.
- **Schema-explicit** — mappings are declared YAML, not inferred from payloads.
- **Fail fast** — bad config, unroutable events, and missing adapter capabilities are
  caught at startup, not mid-run.
- **Storage-agnostic** — adapters define *how* to write; mappings define *what*.

## What Conduit is not

Not a streaming platform (no Kafka-alternative ambitions), not an ETL/ELT tool, not a
workflow engine, not a database, not a schema-inference system. It prefers explicitness
over convenience throughout.

## Status

Latest release notes: **[`RELEASES/v0.7.0.md`](RELEASES/v0.7.0.md)**.

Conduit is in an **alpha** phase — core architecture and execution semantics are stable,
but public APIs may still evolve. Intended for early feedback, not production
deployment.
