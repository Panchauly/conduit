//! Phase 28: thin wiring crate. `conduit-core` stopped shipping every
//! networked backend's driver unconditionally — each one (Postgres, and
//! eventually MySQL/Redis/MongoDB/Neo4j) now lives in its own
//! `conduit-adapter-*` crate and resolves via [`conduit_core::ConduitRuntime`]'s
//! instance-scoped adapter registry, exactly like a third-party community
//! backend would. This crate's only job is registering the default set so
//! `conduit-cli` (and any other embedder who wants "every backend works out
//! of the box") stays a one-line call instead of hand-rolling the wiring
//! itself.
//!
//! One Cargo feature per backend (`default = ["all"]` enables every backend
//! currently split out) — an embedder who only needs Postgres can depend on
//! `conduit-adapter-postgres` directly and skip this crate entirely.
