//! Phase 23.1: the backend-agnostic document write path.
//!
//! The read-guard → facet existence pre-check → [`decide`] → apply
//! write/merge/delete → write guard sequence that used to be inlined in
//! `file.rs` lives here once. A backend supplies only a [`DocumentBackend`] —
//! how the guard is read and how the document/guard pair is atomically
//! written. Unlike the KV seam (Phase 22.1), a named facet's merge is **not**
//! done here: `write()` receives the facet's own unmerged fields plus the
//! facet name, and each backend decides how to apply it — a read-merge-write
//! for the file adapter, a native server-side `$set` for MongoDB (Phase
//! 23.3) — because MongoDB can do that atomically without a round trip this
//! layer would otherwise force.

///   wraps the guard write and the target-document write together (they're
///   two different documents in two different collections); a concurrent
///   writer's commit makes ours fail with a retryable
