/// One backend's read/write surface for graph records. Everything a driver

/// (that is [`project_node`] / [`project_edge`]).
///
/// **Public extension surface (Phase 25.1).** Implement this trait for a
/// graph store Conduit doesn't ship (JanusGraph, ArangoDB, etc.) and every
/// graph mapping feature — node/edge facets, deletes, tombstones, detach-delete
/// cascades — works for free. A breaking change to this trait is a breaking
/// change to `conduit-core`, tracked deliberately.
///
/// **The atomicity contract.** `write_node`/`write_edge`/`delete_*` must
/// apply the record and the guard together, indivisibly. This is the
/// flattest of the four guard shapes by necessity, not by choice — see
/// [`GraphGuard`]'s own doc comment for why. Two shapes satisfy the contract
/// in the built-in backends:
/// - **File** ([`super::store`]): a single-writer assumption plus
///   write-to-temp-then-rename, with an explicit incident-edge index kept
///   alongside (Phase 16.2) since the filesystem has no graph structure of
///   its own to query.
/// - **Neo4j** ([`super::neo4j`]): one client-session transaction per event,
///   with an **explicit optimistic CAS** — a `WHERE`-conditioned `SET` on
///   the guard, re-checked against the *current* stored sequence at write
///   time — because Neo4j's per-node write locks alone do **not** prevent a
///   transaction from committing data it read before a concurrent writer
///   committed (unlike MongoDB's snapshot-isolated transactions). Zero rows
///   returned means the CAS lost; map that to `Err(GraphError::WriteConflict)`
///   and let the caller (`Neo4jAdapter::handle()`) retry the whole
///   transaction, bounded. A backend targeting a genuinely serializable /
///   snapshot-isolated store can skip the manual CAS and rely on the
///   transaction's own conflict detection instead, the way MongoDB does —
///   but verify that guarantee for the specific store before assuming it.
