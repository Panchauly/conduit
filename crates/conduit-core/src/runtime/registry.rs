//! Phase 25.2 / 27: the adapter factory registry — the mechanism behind
//! `AdapterConfig::Custom`. Register a factory for an unrecognized `type:`
//! string on an owned [`AdapterRegistry`] (typically via
//! [`crate::runtime::engine::ConduitRuntime::register_adapter_factory`])
//! before adapters are built; from that point on `type: mysql` (or any other
//! name) in the YAML config resolves through here exactly like a built-in
//! adapter type resolves through a fixed `match` arm.
//!
//! **No dynamic loading.** This is Rust's ordinary compile-time extension
//! model — implement [`crate::adapter::StorageAdapter`] (directly, or via one
//! of the four public backend seams), depend on `conduit-core`, register a
//! factory on the runtime you build. `dlopen`/FFI plugin loading is a
//! deliberate non-goal (see the phase doc).
//!
//! **Phase 27:** this used to be a process-wide `static Lazy<Mutex<...>>` —
//! two engines in one process shared (and could stomp) each other's
//! registrations, and tests could only avoid collisions by convention
//! (globally-unique type-name strings). It is now a plain owned value with no
//! `Mutex`/`Send + Sync` requirement of its own — those were only ever needed
//! because the old registry was a global.
