//! Phase 17: the **source** side — the symmetric other half of
//! [`StorageAdapter`](crate::adapter::StorageAdapter). A source is a
//! checkpointed, resumable reader that hands the engine ordered batches of
//! events with a durable position. It does *not* own transport, durability,
//! partitioning, or fan-out (architecture.md §1) — it consumes from something
//! that already has those properties.
